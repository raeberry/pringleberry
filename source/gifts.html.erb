        <p>First, we want to thank you so much for supporting us and cheering for us on our most important day. We truly feel our relationship was shaped by the friends and family who loved and grew with us over the last four years.</p>
        <p>This might sound weird, but Dan and I really donâ€™t need much in terms of typical registry items. What we really want as we bring our lives together is a down payment on a new house and / or new bathrooms in our current condo.
